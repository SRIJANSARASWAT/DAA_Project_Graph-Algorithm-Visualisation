# DAA Project: Graph Algorithm Visualization

This project aims to provide visualizations for Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms, which are used to find minimum spanning trees in graphs.

## Introduction

This visualization tool helps users understand and analyze Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms, which are fundamental in graph theory and network optimization. By visually representing the step-by-step process of constructing a minimum spanning tree, users can gain insights into how these algorithms work and how they differ in their approaches.

## Features

- Visualizations for Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms
- Interactive interface to create and manipulate graphs
- Step-by-step execution of algorithms
- Customizable graph parameters and algorithm settings
- Visualization of the resulting minimum spanning tree

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: You can download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm (Node Package Manager)**: npm is installed automatically with Node.js.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SRIJANSARASWAT/DAA_Project_Graph-Algorithm-Visualisation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd DAA_Project_Graph-Algorithm-Visualisation
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## How to Run

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

3. Alternatively, you can streamline the setup process by installing the "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code.
Once installed, simply open the `index.html` file in your project and launch it with Live Server for instant live preview.## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

1. Create a graph by adding nodes and edges.
2. Choose either Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm.
3. Run the selected algorithm to visualize the construction of the minimum spanning tree.
4. Explore the step-by-step execution of the algorithm and the resulting minimum spanning tree.
